Transcript:
He is a hungry dog, giant and grey, he roams on the beach all day, with his flashing teeth and shaggy jaws. Hour upon hour he gnaws the rumbling, tumbling stones, and bones, bones, bones, bones, the giant sea dog moans. Licking his greasy paws, and when the night wind roars, and the moon drops in the stormy clouds, he bows to his feet, and huffs and sniffs, shaking his wet thighs all over the cliffs, and howls and hollers long and loud. Such a quiet day for May or June, when even the grass is on the dune, playing no more than a ringing tune. With the canopy in his paws, he lies on the sandy shores, so quiet, so quiet, he scarcely snores.
